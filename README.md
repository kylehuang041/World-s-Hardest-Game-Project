For this project, I chose to remake "World's Hardest Game." It is a 2D game where you have to move a square block player to the goal box where there are moving blue circle enemies as obstacles.

Firstly, I made the necessary folders to keep my materials, prefabs, scripts, etc. Then I worked on creating the objects for the visuals of the game. I got an image from google images and removed the player and enemies for the background to be used for my game and made the sprites from Unity as they are simple shapes.

Then I added components to the objects such as having colliders and for the player to have a collider and a rigid body. Afterwards, I worked on the script and watched a youtube tutorial to learn and get help along the way.

I made three scripts for the player, enemies, and game. Add movement for the player, add repitive movement for the enemies, and how the game is set up such as colliding a player with an enemy and goal box. If the player has reached the goal, then it would respawn at the starting initial coordinate, but with faster speed of both player and enemies. As for when a player collides with an enemy, it would respawn.

One of the problems I have faced was that I couldnt' get the collision to work for some reason, I try changing its properties and still couldn't figure it out for some reason even looking through previous projects on collisions.

The most challenging part was collision part as it was not working as intended.

The time taken for this project was about 6 hours.
